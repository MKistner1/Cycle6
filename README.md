Resume Website

Description/Purpose:The purpose of this project is to have a unique way of providing any companies with my resume to display some of my
skills on top of giving them the information they are asking for.

Dependancies: Only thing you need is a web browser since it is based locally.

Usage: This can be used any time for employment purposes.

Future Devlopment: In the future, my intentions are to make this a personal page for a freelancing projects so I might add a store option,
as well as update the look of the page, and more of a branding aspect to it.

This project is related to my course of study because it dealt with html and css which are 2 languages I learned during my studies.
